    Passionate polyglot engineer and entrepreneur with +15 years of experience.

I've mentored engineers, built and managed teams, led projects, pushed initiatives, helped design and improve processes and nurtured products from inception to production.

    I'm able to understand from the lowest level to the overall architecture of a system while aligning and keeping to the goals of the business and the vision of key stakeholders.
